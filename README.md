# QargoSync - Resource Unavailability Synchronization Tool

**Qargo Junior Integration Engineer Assignment - September 2025**

A C# console application that synchronizes resource unavailabilities from an external master data system into a Qargo environment. Built for automated, frequent synchronization to ensure planners have timely access to unavailability data.

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

QargoSync implements a clean architecture solution using the **Repository Pattern** to synchronize unavailability data between two Qargo environments. The tool focuses on 2025 data and provides robust error handling, logging, and security measures as required by the Qargo assignment.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Automated synchronization** of resource unavailabilities between Master and Target environments
- **🏗️ Repository Pattern** implementation for clean code architecture and testability
- **🔐 OAuth2 authentication** with automatic token refresh and caching
- **📊 Comprehensive error handling** and structured logging with Serilog
- **🛡️ Security measures** including secure credential management with GitHub Secrets
- **📅 Date filtering** for 2025 unavailabilities only
- **🔍 Pagination support** for handling large datasets
- **🧪 Dry-run mode** for safe testing and validation

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Valid Qargo API credentials for both Master and Target environments
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jack-Stan/QargoSync.git
cd QargoSync
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### 2. Configuration

Create `src/QargoSync.App/appsettings.local.json` with your credentials:

```json
{
  "QargoSettings": {
    "Master": {
      "BaseUrl": "https://api.qargo.io/ca849acf3cb543a1975722a2882b7712",
      "ClientId": "your-master-client-id",
      "ClientSecret": "your-master-client-secret"
    },
    "Target": {
      "BaseUrl": "https://api.qargo.io/ca849acf3cb543a1975722a2882b7712",
      "ClientId": "your-target-client-id", 
      "ClientSecret": "your-target-client-secret"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
cd src/QargoSync.App

# API exploration mode
dotnet run --explore

# Full synchronization
dotnet run

# With dry-run (preview changes only)
# Set "DryRun": true in appsettings
```

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Pattern

### Repository Pattern Implementation

The application implements the **Repository Pattern** to provide a clean abstraction layer between business logic and data access:

**Core Interfaces:**
- `IResourceRepository` - Operations for resource and unavailability management
- `ISyncRepository` - Synchronization operations between environments
- `IAuthenticationService` - OAuth2 token management
- `IQargoHttpService` - Authenticated HTTP operations

**Concrete Implementations:**
- `QargoResourceRepository` - Qargo API operations
- `QargoSyncRepository` - Synchronization logic and conflict resolution
- `QargoAuthenticationService` - OAuth2 tokens with caching
- `QargoHttpService` - Authenticated HTTP client management

**Benefits:**
- **✅ Testability** - Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing
- **✅ Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns
- **✅ Flexibility** - Easy to swap implementations (e.g., different APIs)
- **✅ Clean Code** - Business logic separated from infrastructure concerns

### Clean Architecture

```
src/
├── QargoSync.App/           # Console application entry point
├── QargoSync.Core/          # Business interfaces and contracts  
├── QargoSync.Infrastructure/ # API implementations and data access
└── QargoSync.Models/        # Data models and DTOs
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Production-Ready Security
- **OAuth2 Client Credentials** flow for API authentication
- **GitHub Secrets** for secure credential management in CI/CD
- **HTTPS-only** communication with APIs
- **Token caching** with automatic refresh (90% lifetime buffer)
- **Secure credential storage** (no hardcoding in source code)
- **Input validation** and sanitization

### Local Development
- `appsettings.local.json` for development (excluded from git)
- Environment variable support for production deployment
- Clear separation between development and production credentials

## 📊 Synchronization Process

1. **🔐 Authentication** - Obtain OAuth2 tokens for both environments
2. **🔍 Resource Discovery** - Fetch all active resources from master environment
3. **📥 Data Retrieval** - Get 2025 unavailabilities for each resource
4. **🔄 Comparison** - Compare master and target data to identify differences
5. **⚡ Synchronization** - Create, update, or delete unavailabilities as needed
6. **📋 Reporting** - Generate detailed sync results and logs

## 📈 Output & Monitoring

The application provides detailed output including:
- Number of resources processed
- Unavailabilities created, updated, and deleted
- Error details and warnings
- Execution time and performance metrics
- Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Logging

### Comprehensive Error Management
- **Structured logging** with Serilog for debugging and monitoring
- **Retry logic** for transient failures
- **Graceful degradation** when individual resources fail
- **Detailed error reporting** with operation summaries
- **Token refresh handling** for expired authentication

### Logging Features
