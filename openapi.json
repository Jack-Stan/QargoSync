{"openapi":"3.1.0","info":{"title":"Qargo TMS API","description":"Qargo API documentation\n# Authentication\n\nThe api requires oauth2 authentication with client id/secret. This should only be used for service to service communication.\n\n## Creating application credentials\n\nApplication client credentials can be created by users with the `Super admin` role in the Qargo application.\nUsers can create and remove application clients by navigating to Configuration -> Organisation Settings (API clients sections).\n\nApplications need to be linked to a valid integration id, identifying the Qargo approved integrator.\nPlease contact [us](mailto:integrations@qargo.com) if you don't have an id yet.\n\n## Obtaining an access token\n\nThe [/auth/token endpoint](#operation/generate_token_auth_token_post) can be used to generate an access token (JWT):\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST https://api.qargo.com/v1/auth/token -H 'Content-type: application/json' -u '<client_id:secret_id>'\n```\n\nThis token will need to be refreshed after expiration (we provide the 'expires_in' in the token response to check validity).\n\n## Rate limits\n\nThe api has the following rate limits:\n\n- Token refresh rate (token/auth): 5 requests/hour\n- Other api requests: 500 requests/hour\n\n## Pagination\n\nSome list endpoints support pagination. This means the endpoint offers a `next_cursor` in the response payload and accepts a `cursor` as query parameter. If pagination is supported and their response contains a `next_cursor` property, then you can use the `cursor` as a query parameter in a subsequent request to fetch the next page of results. Using query parameters is mutually exclusive with using the cursor.\n\n# Concepts\n\n## Company\n\nA company in Qargo can be both a customer as well as a subcontractor (supplier).\nThe entity will have a single id within Qargo. The api client can link companies by this id,\nor by the accounting code, which is a user defined code field.\n\n## Order\n\nTransport order to execute. Also called job in other TMS systems. It contains all transport details:\n\n- Order references\n- Customer [company](#section/Concepts/Company)\n- Consigments, with their [stop](#section/Concepts/Stop) locations, time windows, references\n- Definition of the goods to transport\n\n## Stop\n\n- A stop is a part of a transport, at a certain date, optional timeslot and location.\n  In addition to the planned times, it also tracks the actual times for a completed stop.\n  Stops can be linked to [orders](#section/Concepts/Order), or can be defined standalone (for example a cleaning stop).\n  All stops are linked to a Trip.\n\n### Stop group\n\nStops can be grouped together according to their activity and location. This is called a stop group.\n\n## Trip\n\nA trip contains [stops](#section/Concepts/Stop) from various [orders](#section/Concepts/Order), or standalone [stops](#section/Concepts/Stop). It tracks how a certain\ntransport is planned, and who will execute that transport.\n\n## Task\n\nA task is the primary workflow concept in Qargo. Users can define their own flow,\nusing both built-in tasks as well a custom defined ones. For the current accounting use case,\nwe only expose the `post invoice/credit note` task, that allows users to send invoices to an accounting system.\n\n## Resource\n\nA resource in Qargo is a vehicle, driver, trailer or other entity that can be assigned to a [trip](#section/Concepts/Trip).\n\n## Unavailability\n\nAn unavailability indicates that a specific [resource](<(#section/Concepts/Resource)>) is not available for use for a given time range. An unavailability has a reason to indicate why the resource is not available.\n\n## Status update\n\nA status update reflects a status change in an entity.\n\n## Document\n\nA document in Qargo can be identified by a unique id. It has a type and is linked to a certain entity (for example an order).\n\n# Postman collection\n\nWe have a [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) collection [available](/ca849acf3cb543a1975722a2882b7712/docs/postman.json \"download\")\nwith interactive examples (right click to download). Download this to a local folder, and import it into Postman for usage.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- Make sure you have a Postman client available. This can either be a local installed version or the web based version.\n- Request credentials for the Qargo API for order creation\n- Download and import the collection\n- Set the collection variables username and password with the credentials received\n- Execute the Request Access token request in the Authentication folder. You have now a valid access key for 1 hour. If you get the error message that the key is no longer valid, please refresh the access key by invoking this endpoint again.\n- You can now explore the different order endpoints\n# Functionality\n\nThe api exposes the following functionality:\n\n- Order management: create/update and get the status of transport orders.\n- Retrieve trip information: retrieve information about Qargo [trips](#section/Concepts/Trip).\n- Visibility: send events to an external system using webhooks.\n- Order dispatch: send transport orders to a 3rd party using webhooks.\n- Accounting: interface an accounting system using the api endpoints.\n- Documents: interface to download documents\n\n## Order management\n\nAvailable functionality:\n\n- Create [orders](#section/Concepts/Order) in Qargo and track order status.\n- Export any existing order to be used as a template for future order creation.\n\nThe api reference is available here: [order api](#tag/API-Order).\n\n## Trip information\n\n[Trips](#section/Concepts/Trip) can't be manipulated yet through the api, but it is possible to retrieve trip information.\nWe currently have an endpoint available to retrieve the charge information for a certain endpoint.\n\nYou can update the status of [stops](#section/Concepts/Stop) and [stop groups](#section/Concepts/Stop) of a trip using a [webhook](#tag/Webhooks-inbound/operation/External_status_updatestatus_update_webhook_post).\n\n## Resource management\n\n### Resource\n\n[Resources](#section/Concepts/Resource) this should be used together with the endpoints to fetch unavailabilities as a resource unavailability is linked to a resource.\n\n### Unavailability\n\n[Resource unavailabilities](#section/Concepts/Unavailability) can be managed through the API. The following operations are supported:\n\n- Creating an unavailability for a resource\n- Updating an unavailability for a resource\n- Deleting an unavailability for a resource\n- Fetching an unavailability for a resource\n- Fetching all unavailabilities for a resource\n\nThe goal of these endpoints is to allow external systems to manage the availability of resources in Qargo. An `external_id` is stored alongside the unavailability to allow for easy linking between the external system and Qargo. This `external_id` should be provided if a referential link is needed between the external system and Qargo.\n\nSee the [examples](#section/Resources/Unavailabilities) on how to use the unavailability endpoints.\n\n## Visibility\n\nWe support visibility (sending messages triggered by Qargo system events) in the api as well.\nThese messages can be send out as a [webhook](#tag/Reference-Webhooks-outbound/operation/Visibility_eventvisibility_webhook_post), or an EDI connection.\n\nFor most endpoints, visibility only trigger on status changes (for example, from stop `IN_PROGRESS` -> `COMPLETED`).\nThere are a few exceptions, these will be indicated in the overview:\n\n- Order level\n  - We send out a visibility event on `ACCEPTED` (order created), `REJECTED` (order skipped) and `COMPLETED` (all stops for order completed).\n- Stop level\n  - We send out a visibility event on `AT_STOP` (arrived at stop), `COMPLETED` (all activities completed for stop).\n- Position level (note: for every telematics update)\n- Trip level\n  - We send a visibility event when a trip changes to `PLANNED` and when it transitions to `COMPLETED`.\n- Resource level\n  - We send an event when a resource is assigned to a certain [trip](#section/Concepts/Trip).\n\n## Order dispatch\n\nIt is also possible to subcontract trips to other parties. This is possible using two push endpoints:\n\n- Outgoing dispatched trip [payload](#tag/Reference-Webhooks-outbound/operation/Trip_dispatch_payloadtrip_dispatch_payload_post).\n- Incoming [message format](#tag/Reference-Webhooks-inbound/operation/External_status_updatestatus_update_webhook_post) to update subcontracted status.\n\n\n## Documents\n\nWe offer an interface to download documents. The documents can be fetched using the [document endpoints](#tag/API-Document).\n\n## Request additional endpoints\n\nPlease contact [us](mailto:integrations@qargo.com) for inqueries regarding additional api functionality.\n\n# Transport order creation & status\n\nThis sections details how to construct payloads to create transport orders using the order upload endpoint([/orders/order/upload](#operation/import_order_v1_orders_order_upload_post)).\n\n## Order creation metadata\n\nOrders are not created synchronously via the API. When creating orders via the `POST /orders/order/upload` endpoint, you will receive the following response when creating an order.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"upload_id\": \"<UPLOAD UUID>\",\n  \"upload_status\": \"IN_PROGRESS\",\n  \"upload_url\": \"v1/orders/order/upload/<UPLOAD UUID>\",\n  \"order_id\": null,\n  \"order_url\": null\n}\n```\n\nYou need to store the `upload_id` so you can fetch the status of the order creation by calling `GET /orders/order/upload/<UPLOAD UUID>`\n\nBased on the status of the upload (`upload_status`), you can know if the order is still in the progress of being created or has already been created. Both `order_id` and `order_url` will be filled in when the order has been created. The `order_id` will be filled in with the order id, which can then be used to fetch the order data and status from the system.\n\n**Example payload `GET /orders/order/upload/e01b3db1-4e49-4241-a91e-7534da884d46`** with a created order\n\n```json\n{\n  \"upload_id\": \"e01b3db1-4e49-4241-a91e-7534da884d46\",\n  \"upload_status\": \"COMPLETED\",\n  \"upload_url\": \"v1/orders/order/upload/e01b3db1-4e49-4241-a91e-7534da884d46\",\n  \"order_id\": \"a2a84715-0027-49af-ad30-494c0ccf75cc\",\n  \"order_url\": \"v1/orders/order/a2a84715-0027-49af-ad30-494c0ccf75cc\"\n}\n```\n\n## Order identifier\n\nThe `order_identifier` is used to uniquely identify orders that are being created via the API. This means that the same `order_identifier` needs to be used when updating orders. Multiple identical updates after each other are idempotent and will not fail the request.\n\nThe `order_identifier` main usage is for `deduplication`, you cannot use the `order_identifier` to fetch an order.\n\n## Create an order\n\nThe first example is a simple transport from our london office to our Ghent office.\nPlease note that the transport service will need to be matched with the one in your system.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"CREATE\",\n  \"consignments\": [\n    {\n      \"delivery_stop\": {\n        \"date\": \"2022-05-03\",\n        \"location\": {\n          \"name\": \"Qargo Ghent office\",\n          \"address\": \"Gaston Crommenlaan 4\",\n          \"postal_code\": \"9050\",\n          \"city\": \"Ghent\",\n          \"country\": \"BE\"\n        },\n        \"reference_number\": \"D12345\"\n      },\n      \"pickup_stop\": {\n        \"date\": \"2022-04-21\",\n        \"location\": {\n          \"name\": \"Qargo London office\",\n          \"address\": \"71-91 Aldwych\",\n          \"postal_code\": \"WC2B 4HN\",\n          \"city\": \"London\",\n          \"country\": \"UK\"\n        },\n        \"reference_number\": \"P123456\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"customer_reference_number\": \"T12345\",\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"code\": \"00020\"\n  },\n  \"instructions\": \"<instructions go here>\",\n  \"message_timestamp\": \"2022-05-02T11:37:15.417Z\",\n  \"order_identifier\": \"T1234393\",\n  \"transport_service\": {\n    \"name\": \"General\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: it is possible to 'export' existing orders in the api to use as examples/templates.\nSee the [Export existing orders](#section/Transport-order-creation-and-status/Export-an-existing-order) section.\n\n## Update an order\n\nThe following order is an update of an existing order. Note the `UPDATE` value of the operation field.\n\nImportant remarks:\n\n- Not all the fields of the order can be updated\n- the `order_identifier` field is used to identify the order to update\n\n**Example of an order update**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"order_identifier\": \"QARGO_TEST_0001\",\n  \"operation\": \"UPDATE\",\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"name\": \"UPS SCS Coventry\"\n  },\n  \"consignments\": [\n    {\n      \"pickup_stop\": {\n        \"location\": {\n          \"name\": \"Qargo HQ\",\n          \"address\": \"Gaston Crommenlaan 4,\",\n          \"postal_code\": \"9000\",\n          \"city\": \"Gent\",\n          \"state\": \"Oost-Vlaanderen\",\n          \"country\": \"BE\",\n          \"description\": \"Qargo HQ building\"\n        },\n        \"note\": \"Pickup 4 boxes of pasta\",\n        \"date\": \"2024-08-20\",\n        \"reference_number\": \"QACOLLI001\",\n        \"instructions\": \"If closed, call mobile number\",\n        \"email\": \"info@qargo.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"+0912341431\",\n        \"mobile_number\": \"+324567890\"\n      },\n      \"delivery_stop\": {\n        \"location\": {\n          \"name\": \"Grocery store\",\n          \"address\": \"Resedastraat 20\",\n          \"postal_code\": \"9000\",\n          \"city\": \"Gent\",\n          \"state\": \"Oost-Vlaanderen\",\n          \"country\": \"BE\",\n          \"description\": \"Grocery store\"\n        },\n        \"note\": \"Don't forget sign the documsn\",\n        \"date\": \"2024-08-21\",\n        \"reference_number\": \"QADELIV001\",\n        \"instructions\": \"Alarm code: 123456\",\n        \"email\": \"info@qargo.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"02123456\",\n        \"mobile_number\": \"+329998888\"\n      },\n      \"goods\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"4 boxes of pasta\",\n          \"quantity\": 4\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"customer_reference_number\": \"QARGO_TEST_0001\",\n  \"transport_service\": {\n    \"code\": \"CONTAINER_BOOKING\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Cancel an order\n\nTo cancel an order, pass `DELETE` as `operation` value. This will cancel the order. If the order has already been cancelled, this will not result in an error. Executing multiple cancellations is a idempotent operation and will not fail the request.\n\nA cancelled order cannot be uncancelled. If you need to revert the cancel, you will need to recreate the original order **using a different order identifier**. Using the same order identifier will cause the system to try to update the cancelled order, which results in an error.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"DELETE\",\n  \"consignments\": [\n    {\n      \"delivery_stop\": {\n        \"date\": \"2022-05-03\",\n        \"location\": {\n          \"name\": \"Qargo Ghent office\",\n          \"address\": \"Gaston Crommenlaan 4\",\n          \"postal_code\": \"9050\",\n          \"city\": \"Ghent\",\n          \"country\": \"BE\"\n        },\n        \"reference_number\": \"D12345\"\n      },\n      \"pickup_stop\": {\n        \"date\": \"2022-04-21\",\n        \"location\": {\n          \"name\": \"Qargo London office\",\n          \"address\": \"71-91 Aldwych\",\n          \"postal_code\": \"WC2B 4HN\",\n          \"city\": \"London\",\n          \"country\": \"UK\"\n        },\n        \"reference_number\": \"P123456\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"customer_reference_number\": \"T12345\",\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"code\": \"00020\"\n  },\n  \"instructions\": \"<instructions go here>\",\n  \"message_timestamp\": \"2022-05-02T11:37:15.417Z\",\n  \"order_identifier\": \"T1234393\",\n  \"transport_service\": {\n    \"name\": \"General\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Export an existing order\n\nIt is possible to export a manually created order in the api. We first need to determine the technical id of this order.\n\n![Retrieve order id](/ca849acf3cb543a1975722a2882b7712/docs/static/order_id.png).\n\nThe order can be exported with the following endpoint:\n[Export order](#tag/API-Order/operation/order_export_v1_orders_order__order_id__export_get).\nThe output of this endpoint corresponds to the order creation format. Just make sure to use a different [`order_identifier`](#section/Transport-order-creation-and-status/Order-identifier), otherwise the 'new' order will be interpreted as an update.\n\n\n## Fetch order data and status\n\nWith the `GET /orders/order/<ORDER UUID>` [endpoint](#operation/get_order_details_v1_orders_order__order_id__get), you can fetch the data related to the order. This contains the current `status` of the order along with other data.\n\n## Container orders\n\nThere are 2 types of container orders that can be created using the API, `IMPORT` and `EXPORT`.\n\n### Import\n\nThis scenario contains of 2 main stops additional optional stops.\n\n1. Pickup of a loaded container\n2. Unload container\n3. Drop off empty container (Optional, configured in `teardown_stops`)\n\nThe `container_scenario` property is set as `IMPORT` and the drop off location of the container is specified in the the `teardown_stops` property.

These stops can be added to configure additional stops related to the order.\n\nThese stops can be defined in the `standalone_stops` property.\n\nUsing `standalone_stops` to configure stops adds the following requirements to the order:\n\n1. Every stop needs to have a unique positive integer assigned to it. This will determine the sequence of the stops in the order.\n2. Every stops needs to have a `custom_activity` assigned to it. This will determine the type of stop that is being added to the order.\n\n**Example custom stops for an order**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"order_identifier\": \"QARGO_TEST_0004\",\n  \"operation\":

You can also provide additional information in the payload\nwhich can be mapped to different fields in Qargo.\n\n## Booking\n\nThis [webhook](#tag/Webhooks-inbound/operation/Intermodal_booking_status_webhook_payloadintermodal_booking_status_incoming_post) is not yet available at this time.\n\n# Visibility\n\nWe support visibility (sending messages triggered by Qargo system events) in the api as well.\nThese messages can be send out as a [webhook](#tag/Reference-Webhooks-outbound/operation/Visibility_eventvisibility_webhook_post), or an EDI connection.\n\nFor most endpoints, visibility only trigger on status changes (for example, from stop `IN_PROGRESS` -> `COMPLETED`).\nThere are a few exceptions, these will be indicated in the overview:\n\n- Order level\n  - We send out a visibility event on `ACCEPTED` (order created), `REJECTED` (order skipped) and `COMPLETED` (all stops for order completed).\n- Stop level\n  - We send out a visibility event on `AT_STOP` (arrived at stop), `COMPLETED` (all activities completed for stop).\n- Position level (note: for every telematics update)\n- Trip level\n  - We send a visibility event when a trip changes to `PLANNED` and when it transitions to `COMPLETED`.\n- Resource level\n  - We send an event when a resource is assigned to a certain [trip](#section/Concepts/Trip).\n# Accounting\n\nThe following section details how to use our api for accounting integrations.\nYou can push/pull accounting information between Qargo and the accounting system.\n\nPlease note that this is not suitable for BI/analytics purposes.\nWe offer a SQL based data warehouse connector to support this use case.\n\n## Synchronize invoices/credit notes\n\nThe flow for sales/purchase invoices and sales credit notes is the same, with a different payload.\nWe will show an example of syncing a sales invoices below\n\nWe use a task oriented approach to indicate which invoice to sync (post in the accounting software).\nThe implementer should take the following steps:\n\n- Fetch a list of available tasks (tasks in a TODO state)\n- For each available task:\n- Fetch the payload in the task details\n- Sync the data to the accounting system.\n- Report the status back, this result can be success or failure.\n\n![Sync invoice/credit note flow](/ca849acf3cb543a1975722a2882b7712/docs/static/sync_invoice_flow.svg)\n\nIt is allowed to only process a subset of the available tasks and process the remaining invoices later.\n\n### Example\n\nFetch the Invoice/Credit notes to sync using [sync tasks endpoint](#tag/API-Accounting/operation/List_invoices_credit_notes_to_sync_v1_accounting_sync_tasks_get)\n\n```\ncurl https://api.qargo.com/v1/accounting/sync-tasks -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*'\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```json\n{ \"tasks\": [{ \"id\": \"*id_of_first_task*\" }] }\n```\n\nNote that as long as an endpoint is not marked as completed/failed, it will still show up as an available POST task.\n\nFetch the first payload:\n\n<pre>\ncurl https://api.qargo.com/v1/accounting/sync-tasks/*id_of_first_task* -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*'\n</pre>\n\nResponse:\n\n<pre>\n{\"id\": \"<id_of_first_task>\", \"status\": \"TODO\", \"TASK_TYPE\": \"POST_INVOICE\", \"payload\": {....}}\n</pre>\n\n<!--\nFetch the invoice document (when required).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.qargo.com/v1/documents/document/*id_of_document*/download -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*' -O\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```\n* Document content *\n```\n\nComplete the first task:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.qargo.com/v1/accounting/sync-tasks/*id_of_first_task*/update-status -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*' -d '{\"status\": \"COMPLETED\"}'\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```json\n{\"id\": \"<id_of_first_task>\", \"status\": \"COMPLETED\", \"TASK_TYPE\": \"POST_INVOICE\"}\n```\n\n-->\n\n## Fetch updated customer information\n\n### Example\n\n```\ncurl https://api.qargo.com/v1/company/*id_of_customer* -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*'\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```\n{\"id\": \"<id_of_customer>\", ...}\n```\n\nNote: since we embed the customer/supplier company in the invoice payload, it is possible to synchronise these companies as part of the invoice posting flow.\n\n## Synchronize blocked status of customer\n\n### Example\n\nUpdate the customer blocked status:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.qargo.com/v1/company/*id_of_customer* -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*' -d  '{\"blocked\": true}'\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```\n{\"id\": \"<id_of_customer>\", \"blocked\": true, ....}\n```\n\n## Creating contacts for a customer or subcontractor\n\nYou can create a contact for a customer or subcontractor by providing a `contacts` list in the payload.\n\n### Example\n\n```\ncurl -X PATCH https://api.qargo.com/v1/company/*id_of_customer* -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*' -d  '{\"contacts\":[{\"name\":\"Contact name\",\"note\":\"Notes on the contact\",\"phone\":\"+32456789016\",\"email\":\"hello@qargo.com\",\"roles\":[\"BILLING\",\"OPERATIONS\"]}]}'\n```\n\n## Updating contacts for a customer or subcontractor\n\nTo update a contact, you need to provide the `id` of the contact you want to update in the payload.\n\n### Example\n\n```\ncurl -X PATCH https://api.qargo.com/v1/company/*id_of_customer* -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*' -d  '{\"id\": \"3ba86d22-0183-4575-804d-60e0a6fa2f74\", \"contacts\":[{\"name\":\"Contact name\",\"note\":\"Notes on the contact\",\"phone\":\"+32456789016\",\"email\":\"hello@qargo.com\",\"roles\":[\"BILLING\",\"OPERATIONS\"]}]}'\n```\n\n## Archiving a contact for a customer or subcontractor\n\nTo archive a contact, you need to provide the `is_archived` field in the payload along with the `id` of the contact you want to archive.\n\n### Example\n\n```\ncurl -X PATCH https://api.qargo.com/v1/company/*id_of_customer* -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer *access_token*' -d  '{\"is_archived\": true, \"id\": \"3ba86d22-0183-4575-804d-60e0a6fa2f74\", \"contacts\":[{\"name\":\"Contact name\",\"note\":\"Notes on the contact\",\"phone\":\"+32456789016\",\"email\":\"hello@qargo.com\",\"roles\":[\"BILLING\",\"OPERATIONS\"]}]}'\n```\n\n# Resources\n\n## Unavailabilities\n\n### Creating a unavailability\n\nCreating an unavailability is always for a single resource. Currently no bulk unavailability creation is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"DRIVER_HOLIDAY\",\n  \"start_time\": \"2025-01-08T00:00:00+00:00\",\n  \"end_time\": \"2025-01-12T00:00:00+00:00\",\n  \"description\": \"HR reference HR00001\",\n  \"external_id\": \"YOUR_REFERENCE_00001\"\n}\n```\n\n### Updating an unavailability\n\nUpdating an unavailability is always for a single resource. Currently no bulk unavailability updates are supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"DRIVER_HOLIDAY\",\n  \"start_time\": \"2025-01-09T00:00:00+00:00\",\n  \"end_time\": \"2025-01-12T00:00:00+00:00\",\n  \"description\": \"HR reference HR00002, correction 1 day\",\n  \"external_id\": \"YOUR_REFERENCE_00001\"\n}\n```\n\n### Deleting an unavailability\n\nDeleting a unavailability will remove the unavailability from the system. This is not reversable.\n# E-invoicing\n\n> E-invoicing refers to the automated, digital exchange of structured invoice data between businesses (e.g., suppliers and buyers) in a standardized format\n\n## Workflows\n\n### Importing e-invoices into Qargo via webhook\n\nThis [endpoint](<#tag/Use-case-E-invoicing/operation/e-invoicing-webhook>) allows to import e-invoices into Qargo. The e-invoice can either be a purchase invoice or a purchase credit note.\n","version":"1.2.0"},"paths":{"https://<intermodal-booking-receiving-payload>":{"post":{"tags":["Use case / Intermodal [partner]","Webhooks / Outbound"],"summary":"Intermodal Booking Payload","description":"Outbound webhook to send intermodal bookings to the external intermodal booking system.","operationId":"Intermodal_booking_payloadhttps____intermodal_booking_receiving_payload__post","requestBody":{"required":true,"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"anyOf":[{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/IntermodalBookingsPushPayload"},{"type":"string"}],"title":"Body"}}}},"responses":{"200":{"description":"Successful Response","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{}}}},"422":{"description":"Validation Error","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/HTTPValidationError"}}}}}}},"https://<accounting-visibility-event-receiving-payload>":{"post":{"tags":["Use case / Visibility","Webhooks / Outbound","Use case / Accounting"],"summary":"Accounting Visibility Event","description":"Webhook for updates to orders and trips.
